# Memory Card Game

The memory game is a common children's game played with a set of cards. The cards have a pictures on one side and each picture appears on two cards. If the two cards have the same picture, then keep the cards, otherwise turn the cards face down again.

The winner is the person with the most cards when all the cards have been taken.

In this case I've made my own version of this game with ReactJs and give it a twist as a Zelda's game.

## Project Goal

take the logic behind the memory game and reproduce it using ReactJs, components, states, ES6, react libraries, and more. Finally complement with the use of Tailwindscss to provide the styles to the interface.
